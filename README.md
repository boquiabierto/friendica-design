Visual guidance for the Friendica Communication Platform

This repository is being used to design a strong and visual consistent statement of all aspects of what is (obviously!) the most interesting & promising distributed network projects of mankind. And although there are much more advanced distributed networks out there made by trees and although they introduced us to the branching concept, they didn’t make it into a GitHub repo, so meanwhile I’ll stick to friendica for the sake of the internetworking people.

Network for your rights!
