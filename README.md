Visual guidance for the Friendica Communication Platform

All grafic work is licenced CC-BY-NC-SA

This repository is being used to design a strong and visual consistent statement of all aspects of what is (obviously!) the most interesting & promising distributed network project of mankind. And although there are much more advanced distributed networks out there made by trees and although they introduced us to the branching concept, they didn’t make it into a GitHub repo, so meanwhile I’ll stick to friendica for the sake of the internetworking people.


Preface: The Logo
-----------------

I like the actual friendica logo. It’s cute. But the essence is not it’s cuteness nor it’s swedish-flag colors nor it’s rounded corners. It’s the shape of two complementing F’s. Two connected F’s, in equality, one defined by the other. I think that’s just perfect for symbolising a distributed network where not only everybody can join but also every network can fit.


First mission: The Logo
-----------------------

I’ve tried hard to work out this essence and think the proposal recovers it. The “connection” is made visually more firm with a “Dovetail joint”-like assembling known from woodworking.  It’s  what a logo must be:
- legible (it’s an F and you imediatly see the upside-down one because its actually the filled part of the logo)
- scalable (any size, tested down to favicon size)
- reproducible (in any context, on any background)
- distinguishable (back & white unique stamp-like form)
- memorable (know no other F like it, yes it’s a bit ugly, some will say “angry” first time).


Second mission: The Display-Font
--------------------------------

Because I take typography very seriously I know it is able to tell you what the logo (isotype) is all about.  I take Douglas Rushkoff’s second command –live in person– very seriously so friendica is for me simply a digital comunication platform and not any substitute for personal face-to-face communication.  I don’t want to pretend it is with a Comic Sans. So I think the right font should say this: It’s all stylish and fresh and also a bit techie. That’s not bad, isn’t it?
I chosed a OpenSource-font called TitilliumText result of a proyect by students from Italy. As webfont it can be part of any friendica theme (for headers only!).


Third mission: Logo for Red
---------------------------
It’s nearly finished and builds on the same aesthetics principles as the friendica logo but with a more “unattached” (nomadic?) spirit.


Fourth mission: The interface
-----------------------------

Based on Information Architect’s design study for facebook (2006) I’m starting to work on a responsive theme. Progress will be published here and on the upcomming friendica.es site.


I very welcome feedback from designers, coders and friendica-evangelists alike!
